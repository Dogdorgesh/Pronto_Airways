# 🚨 Pronto Airways ✈️
### *Where EVERYONE is Priority!*

Welcome to the official repository of Pronto Airways - the revolutionary airline where every single passenger gets priority treatment! (Resulting in no one being priority, but don't tell our customers that! 🤫)

## 🎭 About This Satirical Airline

Pronto Airways is a fictional satirical airline website that parodies the questionable practices of budget airlines:

- **100% Priority Passengers** - Everyone gets priority boarding! (Good luck with that queue!)
- **Transparent Pricing*** - Base fare from $9.99! (*Additional fees may apply for everything)
- **Secure Login System** - Your password safely stored in our text files!
- **Hidden Fees Galore** - From breathing surcharges to gravity compensation fees
- **Revolutionary Fee Structure** - Even viewing this README has a $2.99 processing fee
